## Motivation

Although there are many projects that offer similar features, they often fall short
in providing a complete package 📦.
For example, some apps can stream music from different platform, but they do not allow 🚫 users to:

- Create a playlist with songs from different sources.
- Provide the option to add your local music library.
- Change the search engine(source) without adjusting some setting.

Another important issue in some of these projects is the quality of code. While it may not be an immediate
concern for users, it becomes a time-consuming and challenging task for maintainers to add new features
in the long run. This can be for several reasons:

- Lack of a clear architecture on how code is organized and communicate across different layers.
- Having mega classes and functions scattered all over the place discarding the SOLID principals.
- The absence of tests, no Unit tests no Widget tests, nothing.

That is *why* I started this project with the goal of creating something beautiful & elegant from the inside-out.
